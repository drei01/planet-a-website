	<h1>About me</h1>

	<p>
		I'm Matt, welcome to Planet A. In 2017 my wife Egle and I got married, moved to Berlin and started living as close to zero waste as we possibly could.
		This blog contains tips and tricks we've picked up along the way and a whole bunch of tasty recipes.
	</p>

	<p>
		I grew up near Norwich a small city in the UK, surrounded by countryside and fields. My upbringing instilled a lifelong love of locally sourced food and cooking. 
		Over the years, I've broadened my culinary horizons and Egle also happens to be a mean baker. Once we move to Berlin, we realised the huge amount of single use plastic
		we were going through. Moving abroad and the culture shift helped up change our lifestyle to live a zero waste life, while still enjoying amazing fresh food.
