        1. Pre heat oven to 300°F / 150°C. Warm the coconut oil until liquid.
        2. Combine all the ingredients except apricots in a bowl and mix well.
        3. Spread the mixture in a thin layer on a lined baking sheet.
        4. Bake for 10 minutes or until starting to go light brown. Be careful not to over cook, 10 minutes should be plenty.

The best bit about this granola is that all the ingredients are very easy to get hold of from your local zero-waste or bulk store so there's not a bit of plastic in sight. Feel free to mix it up a bit, try adding coconut flakes. Why not throw in some raisins and a dash of nutmeg, or mix in chunks of dark chocolate while it's cooling.
