The best bit about this granola is that all the ingredients are very easy to get hold of from your local zero-waste or bulk store so there's not a bit of plastic in sight. Feel free to mix it up a bit, try adding coconut flakes. Why not throw in some raisins and a dash of nutmeg, or mix in chunks of dark chocolate while it's cooling.
