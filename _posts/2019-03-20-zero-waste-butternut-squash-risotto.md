    ingredients:
        - 1kg Butternut Squash, skin on cut into small chunks
        - 1 clove garlic, crushed
        - 1 tsp smoked paprika
        - 2 tbsp olive oil
        - 1 onion, chopped
        - 1 1/2L veg stock
        - 2 knobs butter
        - handful sage leaves
        - 300g risotto rice
        - 1 glass white wine
        - 50g grated parmesan, hard cheese or vegan alternative
        - salt and pepper
        - pinch sunflower or other seeds
        - zest of 1/2 lemon
    directions:
        - Pre heat oven to 392°F / 200°C
        - Spread the chopped squash in a large baking tray and rub with 1tbsp olive oil, the paprika, crushed garlic and half the sage (torn up). Put the tray in the oven to roast for 40 minutes
        - Heat a deep frying pan on a medium heat. Add the other table spoon of oil, 1 knob of butter and the onions. Sweat the onions slowly until they turn transparent, they shouldn't be brown (don't worry too much if this happens though).
        - Stir the rice into the onions until covered in the butter. Leave to cook until the rice starts to turn transparent.
        - Add the wine and simmer for 2 minutes.
        - Add half of the stock and simmer for ~25 minutes, topping up as necessary. The risotto should be creamy, you can add more liquid if it starts to go dry. The rice should have a slight bite to it (al dente).
        - While the risotto is simmering, heat a small frying pan and fry the rest of the sage, the sunflower seeds, lemon zest and a pinch of salt. Once the seeds start to brown, take off the heat and leave to rest.
        - When the squash is cooked, remove from the oven and mash half of it lightly with a fork. Stir through the risotto which should be done by now. Add the rest of the squash whole, the final knob of butter and the grated cheese. Stir it all together and grind in plenty of pepper.
        - Serve a few good dollops in a bowl and sprinkle with the toasted seed/sage mixture.

The good thing about this recipe is there's almost nothing to throw in the compost. The only things you should have left are the onion and garlic skin and hard top of the squash. We leave the skin on the squash, other recipes will tell you to peel it but there's really no need. As with all my recipes, feel free to adapt this one to suit your needs / cupboards. Everything you need here can be purchased from your local market or zero waste shop. The cheese normally has a paper wrapping but you can bring your own box and ask the cheesemonger to use that.
